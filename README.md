# MyApplicationApptimize
This is a simple android application which is been used to perform Visual A/B testing using Apptimize SDK.
I have created a UI Transformation app in which I have eprformed Visual A/B testing on SignIn button.
I have defined primary goal as Click on SignIn button.
I created variant 2 by changing the color of the SignIn button.
When the variant 2 is launched the user simply clicks on SignIn button & the participant is recorded, conversion rate is recorded.
